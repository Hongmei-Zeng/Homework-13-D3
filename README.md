# Homework-13-D3
Based on data.csv, this task includes 3 files:

1. app.js: main code

2. index.html: run it using http://localhost:port (To install serve) to avoid server error

3. style.css: technically all the function code and stylish were achieved in file app.js.
              This file's commended in index.html at the end, though still kept here.
